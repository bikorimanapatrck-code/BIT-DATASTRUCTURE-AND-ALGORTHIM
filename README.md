Summary of Your Inventory Monitoring Code

Working with Integers:

You have a list of stock quantities (stock_quantities).

The code calculates the total, average, minimum, and maximum stock values.

It prints out a summary of these statistics.

Using Strings and f-strings:

You create a formatted inventory report string using f-strings.

This report displays total items and average stock.

Booleans and Conditional Logic:

You define a threshold value (25).

You check if the average and maximum stock values are above the threshold.

Based on this condition, it prints a status message ("Above Standard" or "Below Standard").

Lists Manipulation:

You start with a list of items (items).

You add a new item ("Grapes").

You remove "Bananas" if it exists.

Then you sort the list and print the updated list.

Arrays (Fixed-type Numeric Lists):

You create a fixed-size integer array (arr).

You calculate and compare the sums of the array and the original stock quantities list.

It prints whether the sums are equal or different.

Dictionaries (Records Management):

You have a list of inventory records, each represented as a dictionary with id, name, and value.

You update the value for the item with id 2 ("Oranges").

You remove the item with id 3 ("Mangoes").

Finally, you compute and print the total value of the remaining inventory records.
